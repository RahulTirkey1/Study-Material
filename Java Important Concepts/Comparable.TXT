For normal array sorting of integer,double,float,String,long we can do by,
Arrays.sort(al)            //Here al is an array of primitives of specific type.

Comparable
------------------
Java provides Comparable interface which should be implemented by any custom class if we want to use Arrays or Collections sorting methods.

The Comparable interface has compareTo(T obj) method which is used by sorting methods, you can check any Wrapper, String or Date class to confirm this.
We should override this method in such a way that it returns a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer if “this” object is less than, equal to, or greater than the object passed as an argument.

public class Employee implements Comparable<Employee> 
{
    private int id;
    private String name;

    public int getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
    public Employee(int id, String name)
    {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
    }

public int compareTo(Employee emp) 
{  //let's sort the employee based on an id in ascending order
      return (this.id - emp.id);
}
}

Class Simple
{
public static void main(String args[])
{
Now we can use,
Arrays.sort(al);         //al is the array of Employee objects
}
}
