A class can either implement Runnable Interface or extend Thread class.

Example for Runnable:-
class Work implements Runnable
{
@Override
public void run()
{
//Some code
}
}
class MainWork
{
psvm(String args[])
{
Thread t1=new Thread(new Work());
t1.start();
}}

Example for Thread:-
class Work extends Thread
{
@Override
public void run()
{//Some code
}
class MainWork
{
psvm(String args[])
{
Work t1=new Work();
t1.start();
}}

t1 is a separate thread but the main thread will execute the other tasks.To wait for the thread t1 to die,we have
call t1.join() .This will join with the main thread.
