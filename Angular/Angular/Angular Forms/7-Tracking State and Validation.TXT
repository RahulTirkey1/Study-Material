The following is a list of form-control from Angular which class is applied based on it's state and validity.

  State                                            If True                             If Not True
  --------                                     ----------------                     -----------------
1.The control has been visited                   ng-touched                           ng-untouched
2.The control's value has changed                ng-dirty                             ng-pristine
3.The control's value is valid                   ng-valid                             ng-invalid

For each of these classes, Angular provides a ngModel properties for tracking and validity,
