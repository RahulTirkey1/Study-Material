When we create a normal form then Angular doesn't mo=ind anything. But as soon as we add FormsModule in imports array in app.module.ts
As the import was added and if in the html template it found form tag then Angular attaches a ngForm directive which gives us valuable information relating that form tag.
It could tell what the values of the different form controls are and whether the values are valid or invalid.
Now to hold the referenece to ngForm directive we use a template reference variable

Now in some forms we can have a subgroup within a form that corresponds to a particular details like in Address section, we can have state,city,pincode. We can use ngModelGroup to keep track of it,
Ex:- <div ngModelGroup="address">.......(Input tags for state,city,pincode).....</div>

in app.component.html,
<div class="container-fluid">
  <h2>Bootcamp Enrollment Form</h2>
  {{userForm.value | json}}
  
  <form #userForm="ngForm">                  //We have used #userForm as the template reference variable, Here the ngForm directive exports itself as the string ngForm and by assigning it to a reference variable we control of the directive itself

    <div class="form-group">
      <label>Name</label>
      <input type="text" class="form-control" name="name" ngModel>   //To explicitly tell which of the formcontrols to be tracked we have to use ngModel attribute as a marker. And that html element should have a name attribute otherwise it won't work.
    </div>

    <div class="form-group">
      <label>Email</label>
      <input type="email" class="form-control" name="email" ngModel>
    </div>

    <div class="form-group">
      <label>Phone</label>
      <input type="tel" class="form-control" name="phone" ngModel>

      <select class="custom-select" name="topic" ngModel>
        <option selected value="">I am interested in</option>
        <option *ngFor="let topic of topics">{{ topic }}</option>
