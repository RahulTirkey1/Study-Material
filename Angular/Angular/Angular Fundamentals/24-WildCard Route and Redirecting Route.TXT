Suppose a user types non mentioned url then it should show 404 not found,
We try by creating a component for it,
C:\>ng g c pagenotfound -it -is

app-routing.module.ts,
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { Routes, RouterModule } from '@angular/router';
import { DepartmentListComponent } from './department-list/department-list.component';
import { EmployeeListComponent } from './employee-list/employee-list.component';

const routes: Routes = [
  { path:'', redirectTo:'/departments', pathMatch:'full},        //It should be rendered by default upon ng serve
  { path: 'departments', component: DepartmentListComponent },
  { path: 'employees',   component: EmployeeListComponent }
  { path:'**',component:PageNotFoundComponent }              //This is a wildcard route and it should be at the last, if any route doesn't match then render it.
];

@NgModule({
  imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
  exports: [RouterModule]
})
export class AppRoutingModule { }
export const routingComponents = [DepartmentListComponent, EmployeeListComponent,PageNotFoundComponent]
