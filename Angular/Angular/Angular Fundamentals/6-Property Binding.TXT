Attribute and properties are not the same.
Attributes are defined by HTML.
Properties are defined by DOM.
Attributes initialize DOM properties and they are done.Attribute values cannot change once they are initialized.

Suppose there's an input element like,
<input type="text" value="James">           // Here name is a attribute of input tag and a value is assiged.
Now in console.log,
$0.getAttribute('value')                   //returns James
$0.value                                   //returns James
Now suppose we change the value in the text to "Gosling"
$0.getAttribute('value')                   //returns James
$0.value                                   //returns Gosling   //Here the values actually reflects the DOM

In Angular we are doing binding with the DOM not to the HTML elements.

@Component({
  selector: 'app-test',
  template: `<div>
             
      <input id="{{myId}}" [disabled]="isDisabled"  type="text" value="Vishwas">        //[] is for property binding, we couldn't use interpolation because it works only for strings but we can also encounter situation where we might need boolean values.
      <input [id]="myId" bind-disabled="isDisabled"  type="text" value="Vishwas">       //But if we want to avoid [] then we can also use bind- to bind properties to HTML elements.
    </div>
  `,
  styles: []
})
export class TestComponent implements OnInit {

  public myId = "testId";
  public isDisabled = true;
  constructor() { }

  ngOnInit() {
  }
}
