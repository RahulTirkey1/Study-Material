*A class can implement multiple inheritances.
*Define an interface with a method contract.
*Classes implement the interface accordingly.
*All classes that implement the interface has to override the interface methods.

Example 1:-

Coach.ts file,
export interface Coach {

    getDailyWorkout(): string;
    
}

CricketCoach.ts file,
import { Coach } from "./Coach";

export class CricketCoach implements Coach {

    getDailyWorkout(): string {
        return "Practice your spin bowling technique.";
    }
    
}

GolfCoach.ts
import { Coach } from "./Coach";

export class GolfCoach implements Coach {

    getDailyWorkout(): string {
        return "Hit 100 balls at the golf range.";
    }
    
}

Driver.ts file,
import { CricketCoach } from "./CricketCoach";
import { GolfCoach } from "./GolfCoach";
import { Coach } from "./Coach";

let myCricketCoach = new CricketCoach();
let myGolfCoach = new GolfCoach();

// declare an array for coaches ... initially empty
let theCoaches: Coach[] = [];

// add the coaches to the array
theCoaches.push(myCricketCoach);
theCoaches.push(myGolfCoach);

for (let tempCoach of theCoaches) {
    console.log(tempCoach.getDailyWorkout());
}
