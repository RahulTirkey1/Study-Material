Suppose there is a abc.txt file, in the same directory.
I-> d=open('abc.txt')
I-> e=open(cst.txt)      //This file doesn't exist
O-> FileNotFoundError                         Traceback (most recent call last)
      <ipython-input-51-04f16e9b0505> in <module>
      ----> 1 file=open('abc.txt')
      FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'abc.txt' 
I-> d.read() 
O -> 'Hello Again.\nGood Morning a nice day.\nWelcome.'           //Here it returns in a single line so \n means new line.
I-> d.read()   
O-> ''                                                //Here it returns empty strings as it depends upon the cursor. After the first read the cursor went to last.
I-> d.seek(0)                                         //Places the cursor again at the start
O-> 0 
I-> d.read() 
O -> 'Hello Again.\nGood Morning a nice day.\nWelcome.'
I-> d.readlines()
O->['Hello Again\n',
    'Good Morning\n',
    'Welcome']
I-> e=open('C:\\Program\\cst.txt')              //To open a text file which is present in some other location
I-> d.close()                           //To avoid resource leaks
I-> with open('abc.txt') as d:          //Here we don't have to manually close the file.It is a newer approach
         contents=d.read()
I-> d
O-> 'Hello Again.\nGood Morning a nice day.\nWelcome.'
I-> with open('abc.txt',mode='w') as f:
         f.write('Hello World. \nGod Bless You')
I-> with open('abc.txt',mode='r') as f:

    God Bless You
