Syntax:-
----------
while some_condition:
   #execute_something


We can also use else in while loop,
while some_condition:
   #execute_something
else:
   #execute_something_else

We can use break,continue and pass statements in our loops to add additional functionality.
break: Breaks out of the current closest enclosing loop
continue: Goes to top of the closest enclosing loop
pass: Does Nothing at all
